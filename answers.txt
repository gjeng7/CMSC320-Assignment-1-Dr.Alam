Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: It is a distributed verson control system which allows you to keep track of changes in your project over time, helping you manage different versions of files. It also allows for easy collaboration on the same project, as people can work on the same codebase. Git also allows you to create separate branches for different features or bug fixes, and you can work on the features without affecting the main codebase, and merge once the feature is ready.
