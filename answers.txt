Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Healthcare. It could provide some predictive analytics for disease diagnosis. It can help docutors to predict the likelihood of diseases in patients. Through the analysis of large datasets of patient medical histories, test and lab results, and generic information, machine learning models can be trained to predict diseases such as diabetes or cancer. For example, a model might be able to identify early signs of breast cancer by looking at lots of mammogram images, and by identifiying patterns it can pick up small tumors or tissue irregularties. This can help improve treatment since the cancer is in one of its earliest stages and also improve survival rates. It also provides a second opinion for doctors and radiologists.
